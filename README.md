##Student Management System#


Overview

The Student Management System is a console application built in Java that efficiently manages student records. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. The system features functionalities for adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching for students, as well as generating reports. It also ensures data persistence, allowing student records to be saved and reloaded across different application sessions.

#Features

Add New Student:

Users can add a new student record by entering the roll number, name, course, and marks.

#View All Students:

This feature displays a comprehensive list of all student records along with their details.

#Update Student Information:

Users can modify an existing studentâ€™s name, course, or marks by using their roll number.

#Delete Student Record:

This option allows users to remove a student record from the system using the roll number.

#Search for Student:

Users can search for a student by roll number or name, and the system will display their information if found.

#Generate Reports:

The system calculates and presents a report that includes the total number of students, total marks, and average marks.

#Data Persistence:

All student records are stored in a file (students.dat) to ensure that data is preserved even after the application is closed.
