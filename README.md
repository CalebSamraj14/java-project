##Student Management System#


Overview

The Student Management System is a console application built in Java that efficiently manages student records. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. The system features functionalities for adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching for students, as well as generating reports. It also ensures data persistence, allowing student records to be saved and reloaded across different application sessions.

#Features

Add New Student:

Users can add a new student record by entering the roll number, name, course, and marks.

#View All Students:

This feature displays a comprehensive list of all student records along with their details.

#Update Student Information:

Users can modify an existing studentâ€™s name, course, or marks by using their roll number.

#Delete Student Record:

This option allows users to remove a student record from the system using the roll number.

#Search for Student:

Users can search for a student by roll number or name, and the system will display their information if found.

#Generate Reports:

The system calculates and presents a report that includes the total number of students, total marks, and average marks.

#Data Persistence:

All student records are stored in a file (students.dat) to ensure that data is preserved even after the application is closed.

#Code Explanation

1. Main Class
2. 
The Main class contains the main method, which acts as the entry point for the application. It manages the user interface and menu options.

3. Student Class
4. 
The Student class serves as a model for student records. It includes:

Fields: rollNumber, name, course, and marks.

Getters and setters for encapsulating the data.

A toString method for displaying student details.

3. Menu Options
   
The program presents a menu with options (1-7) for various features. The user selects an option, and the corresponding method is executed.

5. Methods
   
addNewStudent()

Prompts the user to enter the roll number, name, course, and marks of a new student.
Creates a Student object and adds it to the list of students.

viewAllStudents()

This function goes through the list of students and displays all their records.
It also takes care of situations where the list might be empty.

updateStudent()

This function looks for a student using their roll number.
It prompts the user to update the student's name, course, or marks.

deleteStudent()

This function searches for a student by their roll number.
If the student is found, it removes them from the list.

searchStudent()

This function allows the user to find a student by either roll number or name.
It shows the details of the student that matches the search criteria.

generateReport()

This function calculates the total number of students, their total marks, and the average marks.
It presents the report in a format that is easy to understand.

saveStudents()

This function uses ObjectOutputStream to serialize the list of students and save it to a file named students.dat.

loadStudents()

This function uses ObjectInputStream to deserialize and load the list of students from the file when the program starts.

#Usage

To use the program, run it and select an option from the menu.
Follow the prompts to add, update, or view student information.
You can exit the program using option 7, and your data will be saved automatically.
Technologies Used

Language: Java
Persistence: Serialization (File I/O)
Data Structures: ArrayList
How to Run

Compile the program with javac Main.java.
Run it using java Main.
Interact with the menu options as needed.

2. TO DO LIST

Overview
The To-Do List Application is a command-line program built in Java. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, updating, viewing, and organizing tasks. The application ensures data persistence by saving tasks to a file, making it scalable and reusable across sessions. It leverages object-oriented programming principles and serialization for modularity and functionality.

Features
Add Task
Users can add new tasks with a description and priority level (High, Medium, Low).

Remove Task
Users can delete tasks by selecting the corresponding task number from the list.

View Tasks
Displays all tasks in the system, including their description, priority, and completion status.

Update Task
Allows users to modify the description and priority of an existing task.

Mark Task as Completed
Users can mark specific tasks as completed to track progress.

Save and Load Tasks
Saves the tasks to a file and reloads them upon application startup, ensuring persistence between sessions.

Code Explanation
Task Class
Represents a single task.
Implements Serializable to allow saving and loading tasks from a file.
Fields:

description: A string describing the task.

priority: A string representing the task's priority (High, Medium, Low).

isCompleted: A boolean indicating whether the task is completed.

Methods:
Getters and setters for task attributes.

markAsCompleted(): Marks the task as completed.

toString(): Provides a readable representation of the task.

Main Class
The main entry point of the application that handles user interactions and task management.

Key Methods:
addTask
Prompts the user to input a task description and priority, and adds the task to the list.

removeTask
Displays all tasks, allows the user to select a task by its number, and removes it.

viewTasks
Displays all tasks with their description, priority, and status.

updateTask
Enables the user to update the description and priority of a specific task.

markTaskAsCompleted
Marks a specified task as completed by the user.

saveTasks
Saves the current task list to a file (tasks.dat) using Java's object serialization.

loadTasks
Reads tasks from the file at startup. If the file doesn't exist, it initializes an empty task list.

Workflow:
Tasks are loaded from a file when the application starts.
The menu is displayed, and the user can perform operations such as adding, removing, or updating tasks.
Tasks are saved back to the file when the user exits the application.
How to Run the Application
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd to-do-list-app
Compile the Java files:
bash
Copy code
javac Main.java
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
java Main
Follow the on-screen menu to manage your tasks.
File Details
tasks.dat: A serialized file where tasks are saved and loaded.
Main.java: Contains the main logic and handles user interactions.
Task.java: Represents the task model with attributes and methods.
